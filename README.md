## GaragePi - The Raspberry Pi Garage Door Opener

Inspired by [Idiotâ€™s Guide to a Raspberry Pi Garage Door Opener](http://www.driscocity.com/idiots-guide-to-a-raspberry-pi-garage-door-opener/). 
Major changes:
 - Two doors
 - Made the code more dynamic so the pins can be updated easily
 - Changed the pins. For some reason pin 7 and 8 did not work well for out.
